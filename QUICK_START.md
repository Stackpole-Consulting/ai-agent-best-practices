# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with AI Agent Best Practices in 5 minutes.

---

## üéØ What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ A customized copilot instructions file in your project
- ‚úÖ Your AI agent aware of best practices
- ‚úÖ A foundation for production-ready development

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- An existing project (or create a new one)
- Access to an AI coding agent (GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Basic familiarity with your development environment

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### **Step 1: Copy the Core Template** (30 seconds)

Navigate to your project directory and create the `.github` folder:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
cd your-project
mkdir .github -Force
```

**Mac/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
cd your-project
mkdir -p .github
```

Copy the copilot instructions template:

```bash
# If you cloned ai-agent-best-practices locally
cp path/to/ai-agent-best-practices/templates/copilot-instructions-core.md .github/copilot-instructions.md

# Or download directly from GitHub
curl -o .github/copilot-instructions.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackpole-consulting/ai-agent-best-practices/main/templates/copilot-instructions-core.md
```

### **Step 2: Customize for Your Project** (2 minutes)

Open `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your editor.

Ask your AI agent:

> **Prompt:** "Help me customize this copilot instructions file for my project. Here's what I'm building: [describe your project]"

**Examples:**
- "Python FastAPI REST API for a task management system"
- "Node.js CLI tool for analyzing log files"
- "React web application for an e-commerce store"
- "Django backend with PostgreSQL database"

The agent will help you:
- Fill in your technology stack
- Customize file organization for your project type
- Add project-specific best practices
- Set up appropriate testing strategies

### **Step 3: Start Building** (Immediate)

Your AI agent now has context! Start coding and watch it:

‚úÖ **Follow best practices automatically**
- Suggests proper file organization
- Uses appropriate design patterns
- Follows language-specific conventions

‚úÖ **Ask before major decisions**
- "Should I extend existing code or create new?"
- "Is this the right place for this file?"
- "Do we need a new dependency for this?"

‚úÖ **Maintain documentation**
- Updates docs when code changes
- Adds helpful comments
- Keeps README current

‚úÖ **Prevent common mistakes**
- No shortcuts from day one
- Test local before cloud
- Security best practices

## üéì What's Next?

### **Explore Templates**

Copy additional templates as needed:

**Agent Handoff Status** (for complex projects):
```bash
cp templates/agent-handoff-status.md AGENT_HANDOFF_STATUS.md
```
Use this when switching between agent sessions or collaborators.

**Project Organization** (for team projects):
```bash
cp templates/project-organization.md docs/project-organization.md
```
Share with team members for consistent file structure.

### **Read Protocols**

Understanding these will make you more effective:

1. **[Token Budget Monitoring](protocols/token-budget-monitoring.md)** - Prevent context loss
2. **[Conversation Continuity](protocols/conversation-continuity.md)** - Maintain context
3. **[Architectural Decisions](protocols/architectural-decisions.md)** - Extend vs duplicate

### **Study Examples**

See working projects with copilot instructions:

- **[Python FastAPI Example](examples/python-fastapi/)** - REST API structure
- **[Node.js Express Example](examples/nodejs-express/)** - CLI tool patterns
- **[React App Example](examples/react-app/)** - Frontend organization

### **Review Best Practices**

Deep dive into principles:

1. **[Core Principles](best-practices/core-principles.md)** - Foundation
2. **[Data Management](best-practices/data-management.md)** - Handling data properly
3. **[System Architecture](best-practices/system-architecture.md)** - Building scalable systems
4. **[Anti-Patterns](best-practices/anti-patterns.md)** - What to avoid

## üí° Tips for Success

### **1. Ask Your Agent for Help**

Don't customize alone! Use your AI agent:

```
"Review my copilot instructions file. Is there anything I should add 
for a [your project type] project?"
```

### **2. Start Small**

Don't overwhelm yourself:
- ‚úÖ Start with just the core template
- ‚úÖ Add protocols as you need them
- ‚úÖ Expand your framework over time

### **3. Document as You Go**

Let your agent help:
```
"We just made an architectural decision to [what you did]. 
Please update the copilot instructions to reflect this pattern."
```

### **4. Review Periodically**

Every few weeks:
```
"Review our copilot instructions. Should we update anything based 
on how the project has evolved?"
```

---

## üîß Customization Examples

### **For a Python FastAPI Project**

Ask your agent:
```
"Customize these copilot instructions for my Python FastAPI project. 
We use PostgreSQL, JWT auth, and deploy to AWS Lambda."
```

Agent will add:
- FastAPI-specific best practices
- Database connection patterns
- Authentication standards
- Serverless deployment considerations

### **For a React Frontend**

Ask your agent:
```
"Adapt these instructions for my React app using TypeScript, 
Material-UI, and React Query for state management."
```

Agent will add:
- Component organization standards
- TypeScript type safety patterns
- Material-UI theming guidelines
- State management best practices

### **For a Node.js CLI Tool**

Ask your agent:
```
"Customize for my Node.js CLI tool that processes CSV files 
and generates reports."
```

Agent will add:
- CLI argument parsing standards
- File I/O best practices
- Error handling for file operations
- Testing strategies for CLI tools

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### **"Agent isn't following the instructions"**

**Solution:** Check that the file is in the right location:
- ‚úÖ `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (correct)
- ‚ùå `github/copilot-instructions.md` (missing dot)
- ‚ùå `.github/copilot-instructions.txt` (wrong extension)

### **"Instructions feel too generic"**

**Solution:** Ask agent to customize:
```
"These instructions are too generic. Make them specific to 
our [framework] project with [specific requirements]."
```

### **"Too many instructions, agent is overwhelmed"**

**Solution:** Start minimal, expand gradually:
1. Use just the core template first
2. Add protocols one at a time as needed
3. Remove sections not relevant to your project

### **"Agent keeps making the same mistakes"**

**Solution:** Add project-specific anti-patterns:
```
"We keep having [specific issue]. Add this to our anti-patterns 
section with guidance on the right approach."
```
