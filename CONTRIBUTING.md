```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ai-agent-best-practices.git
cd ai-agent-best-practices

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### **3. Make Your Changes**

## üí° Suggesting Features

### **Good Feature Requests Include:**
1. **Problem statement** - What pain point does this solve?
2. **Proposed solution** - Your idea for addressing it
3. **Alternatives considered** - Other approaches you thought about
4. **Examples** - How would this be used in practice?
5. **Priority** - Is this critical, important, or nice-to-have?

### **Example Feature Request**
```
Title: Add protocol for multi-agent collaboration

Problem: When multiple developers use different AI agents on same project,
context gets fragmented and decisions conflict.

Proposed solution: Create protocol for:
- Shared context file all agents reference
- Decision log visible to all agents
- Conflict resolution process

Alternatives:
- Just use agent handoff template (but that's serial, not parallel)
- Have one "lead" agent (but limits team collaboration)

Example use case:
Team of 3 devs, each using different agents (Copilot, Claude, GPT),
working on different features simultaneously.

Priority: Important (addresses real team pain point)
```
